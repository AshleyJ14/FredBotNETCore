# Summary
Fred the G. Cactus Discord bot for Platform Racing Group. Some of the code in this is around a year old. A lot of things could be improved but I haven't really got around to doing it.
If you have suggestions for ways I could improve stuff make a pull request that makes the changes, make an issue, or message me on Discord: Matt.#0001.

If you have come across this and you would like to be in the Platform Racing Group discord server message me on PR2 (Stxtics) or Discord: Matt.#0001 asking for an invite to the server.
